 gsw_data_v3_0.dat
 Contains the global data set of Absolute Salinity Anomaly Ratio RÎ´, and the
 global data set of Absolute Salinity Anomaly atlas.
 The data set gsw_data_v3_0.dat must not be tampered with.

 gsw_check_function.f90
 Contains the check functions. We suggest that after downloading, unzipping
 and installing the toolbox the user runs this program to ensure that the
 toolbox is installed correctly and there are no conflicts. This toolbox has
 been tested to compile and run with gfortran.

 cd toolbox
 gfortran -c *.f90
 cd ../test
 gfortran -c gsw_check_functions.f90
 gfortran -o gsw_check ../toolbox/*.o gsw_check_functions.o
 ./gsw_check

 Note that gfortran is the name of the GNU Fortran project, developing a
 free Fortran 95/2003/2008 compiler for GCC, the GNU Compiler Collection.
 It is available from http://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/
